Constraint equation to be differentiated:
'C2.v' = 'L1.v'
Differentiated equation:
der('C2.v') = der('L1.v')

------------------13------------------
Constraint equation to be differentiated:
'L1.v' = 'C1.v' - 'C3.v'
Differentiated equation:
der('L1.v') = der('C1.v') - der('C3.v') Update Adjacency Matrix: 12 7 13

Constraint equation to be differentiated:
'C4.v' = 'L2.v'
Differentiated equation:
der('C4.v') = der('L2.v')
------------------15------------------
Constraint equation to be differentiated:
'L2.v' = 'C3.v' - 'C5.v'
Differentiated equation:
der('L2.v') = der('C3.v') - der('C5.v') Update Adjacency Matrix: 14 10 15
