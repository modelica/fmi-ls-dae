A differential-algebraic system of equations (DAE) is a system of equations that
either contains differential equations and algebraic equations, or is equivalent
to such a system

* Avoid the requirement of index reduction inside of FMUs.
    ** This may improve accuracy due to better drift handling.
* Avoid local nonlinear equation solvers inside of FMUs.
    ** This may improve accuracy and avoid problems with different local and
       global error tolerances.
* Preserve the sparseness of DAE systems which is lost for the corresponding
  reduced ODE systems.
    ** This may improve the performance by usage of the sparseness.
* Allow connections between constraint FMUs.
    ** Connecting reduced ODE FMUs may lead globally to a non-solvable
       (singular) system but not for unreduced DAE FMUs.
